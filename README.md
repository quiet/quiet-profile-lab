[Try it live](https://quiet.github.com/quiet-profile-lab)

This is a workbench to test and create new modem profiles for [libquiet](https://github.com/quiet/quiet) and [quiet-js](https://github.com/quiet/quiet-js). This lab routes the sound through your speakers and microphone so that you can test your settings in an real environment. It then provides you instrumentation on the received data.
